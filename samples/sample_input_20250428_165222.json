  "mail_body": "Dear Mr. Jones,\n\nI am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received regarding my relocation to London.  The property viewing scheduled with Agent Smith was a complete waste of my time. The property, described as \"spacious and modern,\" was cramped, poorly maintained, and certainly didn't match the photos provided.  Furthermore, Agent Smith was late, unprepared, and displayed a distinct lack of professionalism.  This experience has significantly impacted my relocation process, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. I expect a much higher standard of service from a company of your reputation, and I request a full explanation and appropriate compensation for this unacceptable experience.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
