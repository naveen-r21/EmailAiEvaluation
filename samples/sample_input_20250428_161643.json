  "mail_body": "Dear Mr. Jones,\n\nI am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received regarding my recent relocation.  The property viewing scheduled with Agent Smith was a complete waste of my time. The property was nothing like what was described in the listing, and the condition was far below acceptable standards.  The promised 'fully furnished' apartment lacked essential items, and the cleanliness was appalling.  I feel misled and extremely disappointed with the lack of professionalism displayed.  I expect a significant improvement in service and a more accurate representation of properties in the future.  I will be contacting your management team to formally lodge a complaint.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",
