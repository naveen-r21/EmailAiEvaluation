Despite our best efforts, the options within your budget and preferred location are proving extremely limited. We've shown you everything that remotely fits your criteria, and the feedback has been consistently negative. \n\nTo be blunt, your expectations may be unrealistic given the current market conditions. We're spending considerable time and resources on this search, and I'm starting to question whether we can actually find a suitable property for you. I understand this is frustrating, but I need you to seriously consider adjusting your requirements or increasing your budget. Otherwise, I'm not sure how much further we can progress.\n\nWe have a viewing scheduled for you tomorrow, but honestly, I don't have high hopes. \n\nRegards,\n\nJohn Smith\nRelocation Specialist",
