  "mail_body": "Dear Mr. Jones,\n\nI am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received regarding my relocation to London.  The property you showed me on the 27th was not at all what was described. The photos were clearly misleading, and the property was in a far worse state of repair than advertised.  The promised 'fully furnished' apartment was missing key appliances and the cleanliness was unacceptable. I feel I wasted my time and that your company has misrepresented the property significantly. I expect a full explanation and a resolution to this issue immediately.  I am very disappointed with the level of service provided.\n\nSincerely,\nSarah Miller",
