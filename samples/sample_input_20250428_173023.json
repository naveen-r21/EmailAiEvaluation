  "mail_body": "Dear Mr. Johnson,\n\nI am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the relocation services provided by your company.  The property you arranged in Austin, a supposedly 'furnished' apartment, was far from adequate.  The furniture was old, damaged, and insufficient for comfortable living.  The promised high-speed internet was non-existent, and the advertised 'move-in ready' condition was clearly false.  I had to spend an additional $800 on furniture and internet setup, a cost I should not have incurred. Agent [Smith] was unresponsive to my concerns, and the promised compensation for these issues remains unfulfilled.\n\nThis experience has been incredibly stressful and disruptive to my relocation. I expect immediate action to rectify these problems, including full reimbursement for the unexpected expenses.  I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe\n123 Main Street\nAnytown, CA",
