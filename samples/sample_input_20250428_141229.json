  "mail_body": "Dear [Client Name],\n\nI'm writing to you with an update on your property search, and frankly, it's not good news. After several viewings, we're still struggling to find anything that meets even your most basic requirements within your budget. The market in London is incredibly competitive right now, and properties are being snapped up almost immediately. \n\nWe viewed the apartment on Elm Street today, and as suspected, it was nothing like the photos. The 'newly renovated' kitchen was clearly from the 1970s, and the entire place smelled strongly of damp. I honestly wouldn't recommend it, even if they dropped the price significantly. \n\nI'm starting to feel like we're running in circles here. Perhaps we need to seriously reconsider your budget or expand the search area beyond central London. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nRegards,\n\nJohn Smith\nRelocation Specialist",
