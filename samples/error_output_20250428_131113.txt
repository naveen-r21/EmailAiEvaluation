I was informed that all utilities would be connected by July 12th, but as of today, July 15th, I still have no electricity. I contacted Con Edison multiple times, and they stated that they haven't received any request from your company. This is a major issue, as I cannot move into my new residence without power.</p><p>Furthermore, I'm concerned about the water connection. I haven't been able to confirm with the Water Authority if the service is active. I tried calling your office, but I was on hold for over an hour. This lack of communication is unacceptable. I need confirmation that both electricity and water are connected immediately. I had expected a smoother transition, but this has been incredibly frustrating.</p><p>I await your urgent response.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>John Doe</p></body></html>",
